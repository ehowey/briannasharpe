## Overview

This theme is designed as a starter for freelance writers.

This is a starter site implementing `gatsby-theme-catalyst-writer`. Please see [Gatsby-Theme-Catalyst-Writer](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-theme-catalyst-writer) for all relevant documentation. Please submit and track all issues in the main theme repo as this is where most code changes would be located.
