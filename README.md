## Overview

This is a starter site implementing `gatsby-theme-catalyst-core`. Please see [Gatsby-Theme-Catalyst-Core](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-theme-catalyst-core) for all relevant documentation. Please submit and track all issues in the main theme repo as this is where most code changes would be located.

## Catalyst Themes and Starters

* [Gatsby-Theme-Catalyst-Core](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-theme-catalyst-core): *This acts as the core theme on which all other themes are based. It houses a basic, unstyled, site architecture along with most commonly needed dependencies. Uses theme-ui under the hood for styling changes and MDX for pages.*
  * [Gatsby-Theme-Catalyst-Onepage](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-theme-catalyst-onepage): *Child theme of the core theme. Allows for a single page website with anchor links and smooth scrolling in lieu of a traditional nav menu which would link to different pages*
  * [Gatsby-Starter-Catalyst-Core](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-starter-catalyst-core): *Starter for the core theme to make installation and customization easier*
  * [Gatsby-Starter-Catalyst-Onepage](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-starter-catalyst-onepage): *Starter for the onepage theme to make installation and customization easier*
